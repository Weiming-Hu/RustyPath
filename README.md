When I first installed `rustc` and the `rust-analyzer` plugin in VS Code, the plugin was not working. I found [this thread](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/11558#issuecomment-1054802255). I solved the problem following the second option. But also remember that I was installing on a raspberry pi which might use an older OS.
